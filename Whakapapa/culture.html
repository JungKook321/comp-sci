        <h1>My Cantonese Heritage</h1>
         <h2>Language</h2>
  <p>Cantonese (廣東話) is a tonal language with rich sounds and expressions. It’s widely spoken in Hong Kong, Macau, and by Chinese communities around the world, including Aotearoa New Zealand. While Mandarin is the official language of China, many families like mine continue to speak Cantonese to keep our heritage alive.</p>

  <h2>Food</h2>
  <p>Cantonese cuisine is known globally, especially for dishes like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dim_sum"> dim sum (點心)</a>, <a href="https://thewoksoflife.com/chinese-roast-duck/"> roasted duck</a>, <a href="https://www.recipetineats.com/chinese-barbecue-pork-char-siu/">char siu (BBQ pork)</a>, and congee. Food is an important way we connect as a family, especially during celebrations like Lunar New Year.</p>

  <h2>Traditions</h2>
  <p>In Cantonese culture, we respect our elders, care for our families, and honour our ancestors. During festivals, we often burn incense and offer food to our ancestors to show gratitude and remember where we came from. Red and gold are important colours, they represent good fortune and happiness.</p>
