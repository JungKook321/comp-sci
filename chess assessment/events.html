        At the Grandmasters Chess Club, we host a variety of events throughout the year to bring our 
        members together, improve our skills, and share the joy of chess. From friendly matches to 
        competitive tournaments, there’s something for every player.

            <strong>Weekly Practice Sessions</strong> - Every Thursday evening, members gather for casual 
            games, analysis of famous matches, and one-on-one coaching opportunities.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Monthly Club Tournaments</strong> - A chance to test your skills against other members 
            in a structured and friendly competition. Prizes are awarded for top performers!

        <li>
            <strong>Strategy Workshops</strong> - Learn advanced tactics, endgame techniques, and 
            opening theory from experienced players and guest instructors.
