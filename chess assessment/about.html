    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>
        Founded by a group of passionate players, the Grandmasters Chess Club began as a small gathering 
        in our school library and has since grown into one of the most welcoming and active chess 
        club in Ormiston. Our members range from curious beginners to experienced tournament 
        players, each bringing their own style and enthusiasm to the game.
    </p>
    <p>
        We believe chess is more than just a game, itâ€™s a lifelong skill that builds patience, focus, 
        problem-solving, and sportsmanship. Our club fosters a friendly, inclusive environment where 
        everyone is encouraged to learn, share ideas, and improve their play, no matter their starting point.
    </p>
    <p>
        Beyond weekly meetups, we organize themed events, strategy workshops, and even casual social nights 
        to strengthen our community bond. We aim to make chess accessible, enjoyable, and inspiring for 
        everyone who walks through our doors.
    </p>
